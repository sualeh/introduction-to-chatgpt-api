# Introduction to ChatGPT API

**Sualeh Fatehi**

## Agenda

- Setting up the ChatGPT API
- Making a request
- Maintaining context
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Functions


## Not on the Agenda

- Fine-tuning
- Assistants


## Why Use the API?

- **Integration**: integrate ChatGPT into your own applications, products, or services
- **Customization**: get more control over the user experience
- **Automation**: automate tasks
- **Data Privacy**: data stays within your own systems


## Terms

- **Prompt**: initial input or question that you provide to the model
- **Completion**: text that the model generates as a continuation of the prompt
- **Token**: a single unit of text
- **Model**: a machine learning model trained on a dataset, that can make predictions


## Techniques

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: 
  - uses retrieval-based model to find relevant documents
  - then uses generative model to generate response 
- **Function**: specific operation or calculation that the model recommends
- **Fine-tuning**: training a pre-trained model on a specific task


## Roles

- **System**: used to set the behavior of the assistant at the start
- **User**: used for prompts that come from the user
- **Assistant**: represents the responses generated by the ChatGPT model


## Context

- ChatGPT API is REST-ful - no state is maintained
- For a meaningful conversation, maintain state yourself


## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- **Document Retrieval**: retrieve a set of documents from a corpus
- **Contextual Encoding**: documents and the query are encoded (embedded) into a context vector
- **Generation**: takes the context vector and generates a response


## Functions

- Describe capabilities of your system or software
- Model capabilities as function calls 
  - Function name and arguments
  - Comments (like javadocs or XML documentation)
- ChatGPT will recommend a function will satisfy a prompt
